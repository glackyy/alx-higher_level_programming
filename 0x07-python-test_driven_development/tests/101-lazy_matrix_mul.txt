How to Use 101-lazy_matrix_mul.py with NumPy
===============================================

This module defines a matrix multiplication function `lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)` using the NumPy module.

Requirements
============
Before using the `lazy_matrix_mul()` function, make sure you have installed NumPy version 1.15.0. You can install it using the following command:
pip3 install numpy==1.15.0


Usage
=====
The `lazy_matrix_mul(...)` function returns a new matrix representing the multiplication of `m_a` by `m_b` using NumPy.

Example 1:
----------
```python
lazy_matrix_mul = __import__('101-lazy_matrix_mul').lazy_matrix_mul

m_a = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
]
m_b = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
]

print(lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
[[ 7 10]
 [15 22]]

m_a = [[1, 2]]
m_b = [
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6]
]

print(lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
[[13 16]]

The function uses NumPy arrays to perform matrix multiplication efficiently. The resulting matrix is also a NumPy array.

Handling Errors
The lazy_matrix_mul() function enforces similar requirements on the input matrices as the previous implementation. However, it raises different exception types and messages.

Here are the possible errors and their respective error messages:

ValueError: A minimum of two arguments (m_a and m_b) must be provided.
ValueError: The matrices m_a and m_b cannot be empty.
TypeError: The parameters m_a and m_b must be lists.
TypeError: The parameters m_a and m_b must be lists of lists.
TypeError: The matrices m_a and m_b must contain only integers or floats.
ValueError: The matrices m_a and m_b cannot be multiplied.
NumPy Requirement
To use the lazy_matrix_mul() function, NumPy must be installed. If NumPy is not installed or the required version is not available, the function will raise an error.

Invalid Matrices
If the input matrices do not meet the requirements, the lazy_matrix_mul() function will raise appropriate error messages. Here are some examples of invalid matrices:

Matrices must be lists of lists, and each inner list must contain only integers or floats.
Matrices must have rows of the same size.
Matrices cannot be empty.
Matrices must have compatible dimensions for multiplication.
By ensuring that the input matrices meet the requirements, installing NumPy, and handling the possible error cases, you can effectively use the lazy_matrix_mul() function for matrix multiplication with the help of NumPy.
