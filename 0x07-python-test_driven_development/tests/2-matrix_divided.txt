How to Use matrix_divided.py
==============================

This module defines a function `matrix_divided(matrix, div)` that divides all elements of a matrix by a given number.

Usage
=====

Function Signature:
    matrix_divided(matrix, div)

Parameters:
    - matrix: A list of lists containing integers or floats.
    - div: A number (integer or float) to divide the matrix elements by.

Returns:
    - A new matrix with all elements divided by `div`, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Example:
---------

Consider the following matrix:

    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]
    ]

To divide the elements of the matrix by 3, you can use the function as follows:

    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Note that the original matrix remains unchanged:

    >>> matrix
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Error Handling
==============

The `matrix_divided()` function performs several error checks:

- If the `matrix` argument is not a list of lists of integers or floats, a `TypeError` is raised with the message "matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats".

- If the rows of the matrix are not of the same size, a `TypeError` is raised with the message "Each row of the matrix must have the same size".

- If the `div` argument is not a number (integer or float), a `TypeError` is raised with the message "div must be a number".

- If `div` is equal to 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised with the message "division by zero".

Let's consider an example:

    >>> matrix_divided("invalid", 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]], 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "invalid")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: div must be a number

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

In each case, the corresponding error is raised with the appropriate error message.
